Summary: a Knight's Tour-esque recursive pathfinding algo

1. consecutive recursive calls testing cells directly north, east, south, & west of current pos

2. mark locations already visited w/ -1, so that pathfinder knows when it's defeated

3. if wall or -1-space hit, backtrack

4. if algo leads to end space, exit
